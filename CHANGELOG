- `FRAME_TYPE`, `DISCOVERY_STATUS`, `DELIVERY_STATUS`, `COMMAND_STATUS`, `MODEM_STATUS`, `RECEIVE_OPTIONS`, and `DEVICE_TYPE` can no longer be queried to get the name of the value. Please use `FOO_NAME` instead.
- PIN_MODE no longer contains the reverse number-to-mode mapping. If you need this functionality, please implement it yourself using `.filter()`
- some internal helper methods that should never have been exposed are no longer exposed.
- support for old node-serialport has been dropped
- support for old (<14) node has been dropped
- `DEVICE_AUTHENITCATED_INDICATOR` -> `DEVICE_AUTHENTICATED_INDICATOR`, `MAC_ACK_FALIURE` -> `MAC_ACK_FAILURE`
- `rawParser()` has been removed, since it's only usable with Node Serialport 4.0.7. `newStream` has also been removed since it is only compatible with old Serialport.
- Literal AT command values must be replaced with the AT_COMMAND enum
